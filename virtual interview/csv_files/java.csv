List two Java IDE,Netbeans Eclipse etc.
What is a Class Variable?,These are variables declared with in a class outside any method with the static keyword.
What do you mean by Constructor?,Constructor gets invoked when a new object is created. Every class has a constructor. If we do not explicitly write a constructor for a class the java compiler builds a default constructor for that class.
List any five features of Java?,Some features include Object Oriented Platform Independent Robust Interpreted Multi-threaded
What is an Exception?,An exception is a problem that arises during the execution of a program. Exceptions are caught by handlers positioned along the thread's method invocation stack.
What is Java?,Java is the high-level object-oriented robust secure programming language platform-independent high performance Multithreaded and portable programming language.
List the features of Java Programming language?,simple object oriented portable platform independent secure robust interpreted distributed dynamic.
What do you understand by Java virtual machine?,Java Virtual Machine is a virtual machine that enables the computer to run the Java program. JVM acts like a run-time engine which calls the main method present in the Java code. JVM is the specification which must be implemented in the computer system. The Java code is compiled by JVM to be a Bytecode which is machine independent and close to the native code.
How many types of memory areas are allocated by JVM?,class area heap stack program counter register native method stack.
What is JIT compiler?,Just-In-Time(JIT) compiler: It is used to improve the performance. JIT compiles parts of the bytecode that have similar functionality at the same time and hence reduces the amount of time needed for compilation.
What is the platform?,A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a piece of software is executed. There are two types of platforms software-based and hardware-based. Java provides the software-based platform.
What are the main differences between the Java platform and other platforms?,Java is the software-based platform whereas other platforms may be the hardware platforms or software-based platforms.Java is executed on the top of other hardware platforms whereas other platforms can only have the hardware components.
What gives Java its 'write once and run anywhere' nature?,The bytecode. Java compiler converts the Java programs into the class file (Byte Code) which is the intermediate language between source code and machine code. This bytecode is not platform specific and can be executed on any computer.
What is classloader?,Classloader is a subsystem of JVM which is used to load class files. Whenever we run the java program it is loaded first by the classloader. There are three built-in classloaders in Java.
Is Empty .java file name a valid source file name?,Yes Java allows to save our java file by .java only we need to compile it by javac .java and run by java classname.
Is delete next main exit or null keyword in java?,No.
If I don't provide any arguments on the command line then what will the value stored in the String array passed into the main() method empty or NULL?,It is empty but not null.
What if I write static public void instead of public static void?,The program compiles and runs correctly because the order of specifiers doesn't matter in Java.
What is the default value of the local variables?,The local variables are not initialized to any default value neither primitives nor object references.
What are the various access specifiers in Java?,In Java access specifiers are the keywords which are used to define the access scope of the method class or a variable.public protected private default.
What is the purpose of static methods and variables?,The methods or variables defined as static are shared among all the objects of the class. The static is the part of the class and not of the object. The static variables are stored in the class area and we do not need to create the object to access such variables.
What are the advantages of Packages in Java?,There are various advantages of defining packages in Java.Packages avoid the name clashes.The Package provides easier access control.It is easier to locate the related classes.
What is object-oriented paradigm?,It is a programming paradigm based on objects having data and methods defined in the class to which it belongs. Object-oriented paradigm aims to incorporate the advantages of modularity and reusability.
What is an object?,The Object is the real-time entity having some state and behavior. In Java Object is an instance of the class having the instance variables as the state of the object and the methods as the behavior of the object. The object of a class can be created by using the new keyword.
What will be the initial value of an object reference which is defined as an instance variable?,All object references are initialized to null in Java.
What is the constructor?,The constructor can be defined as the special type of method that is used to initialize the state of an object. It is invoked when the class is instantiated and the memory is allocated for the object. Every time an object is created using the new keyword the default constructor of the class is called. The name of the constructor must be similar to the class name. The constructor must not have an explicit return type.
How many types of constructors are used in Java?,Based on the parameters passed in the constructors there are two types of constructors in Java.
What is the purpose of a default constructor?,The purpose of the default constructor is to assign the default value to the objects. The java compiler creates a default constructor implicitly if there is no constructor in the class.
Does constructor return any value?,yes The constructor implicitly returns the current instance of the class.
Is constructor inherited?,No The constructor is not inherited.
Can you make a constructor final?,No the constructor can't be final.
Can we overload the constructors?,Yes the constructors can be overloaded by changing the number of arguments accepted by the constructor or by changing the data type of the parameters.
What do you understand by copy constructor in Java?,There is no copy constructor in java. However we can copy the values from one object to another like copy constructor in C++.
What is the static variable?,The static variable is used to refer to the common property of all objects (that is not unique for each object) e.g. The company name of employees college name of students etc. Static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading. Using a static variable makes your program more memory efficient (it saves memory). Static variable belongs to the class rather than the object.
What is the static method?,A static method belongs to the class rather than the object.There is no need to create the object to call the static methods.A static method can access and change the value of the static variable
What are the restrictions that are applied to the Java static methods?,The static method can not use non-static data member or call the non-static method directly.this and super cannot be used in static context as they are non-static.
Why is the main method static?,Because the object is not required to call the static method. If we make the main method non-static JVM will have to create its object first and then call main() method which will lead to the extra memory allocation.
Can we override the static methods?,No we can't override static methods.
What is the static block?,Static block is used to initialize the static data member. It is executed before the main method at the time of classloading.
Can we execute a program without main() method?,No It was possible before JDK 1.7 using the static block. Since JDK 1.7 it is not possible.
What if the static modifier is removed from the signature of the main method?,Program compiles. However at runtime It throws an error "NoSuchMethodError."
Can we make constructors static?,As we know that the static context (method block or variable) belongs to the class not the object. Since Constructors are invoked only when the object is created there is no sense to make the constructors static. However if you try to do so the compiler will show the compiler error.
Can we make the abstract methods static in Java?,In Java if we make the abstract methods static It will become the part of the class and we can directly call it which is unnecessary. Calling an undefined method is completely useless therefore it is not allowed.
Can we declare the static variables and methods in an abstract class?,Yes we can declare static variables and methods in an abstract method. As we know that there is no requirement to make the object to access the static context therefore we can access the static context declared inside the abstract class by using the name of the abstract class.
What is this keyword in java?,The this keyword is a reference variable that refers to the current object. There are the various uses of this keyword in Java. It can be used to refer to current class properties such as instance methods variable constructors etc. It can also be passed as an argument into the methods or constructors. It can also be returned from the method as the current class instance. 
Can we assign the reference to this variable?,No this cannot be assigned to any value because it always points to the current class object and this is the final reference in Java.
Can this keyword be used to refer static members?,Yes It is possible to use this keyword to refer static members because this is just a reference variable which refers to the current class object. 
How can constructor chaining be done using this keyword?,Constructor chaining enables us to call one constructor from another constructor of the class with respect to the current class object. We can use this keyword to perform constructor chaining within the same class.
What is the Inheritance?,Inheritance is a mechanism by which one object acquires all the properties and behavior of another object of another class. It is used for Code Reusability and Method Overriding. 
Why is Inheritance used in Java?,Inheritance provides code reusability. The derived class does not need to redefine the method of base class unless it needs to provide the specific implementation of the method.Runtime polymorphism cannot be achieved without using inheritance.Inheritance provides data hiding. The base class can hide some data from the derived class by making it private.
Which class is the superclass for all the classes?,The object class is the superclass of all other classes in Java.
Why is multiple inheritance not supported in java?,To reduce the complexity and simplify the language multiple inheritance is not supported in java. Consider a scenario where A B and C are three classes. The C class inherits A and B classes. If A and B classes have the same method and you call it from child class object there will be ambiguity to call the method of A or B class.
What is aggregation?,Aggregation can be defined as the relationship between two classes where the aggregate class contains a reference to the class it owns. Aggregation is best described as a has-a relationship. 
What is composition?,Holding the reference of a class within some other class is known as composition. When an object contains the other object if the contained object cannot exist without the existence of container object then it is called composition.
What is the difference between aggregation and composition?,Aggregation represents the weak relationship whereas composition represents the strong relationship. For example the bike has an indicator (aggregation) but the bike has an engine (composition).
Why does Java not support pointers?,The pointer is a variable that refers to the memory address. They are not used in Java because they are unsafe(unsecured) and complex to understand.
What is super in java?,The super keyword in Java is a reference variable that is used to refer to the immediate parent class object. Whenever you create the instance of the subclass an instance of the parent class is created implicitly which is referred by super reference variable.
What are the main uses of the super keyword?,super can be used to refer to the immediate parent class instance variable.super can be used to invoke the immediate parent class method.
What are the differences between this and super keyword?,The super keyword always points to the parent class contexts whereas this keyword always points to the current class context.The super and this must be the first statement inside constructor otherwise the compiler will throw an error.
Can you use this() and super() both in a constructor?,No because this() and super() must be the first statement in the class constructor.
What is object cloning?,The object cloning is used to create the exact copy of an object. The clone() method of the Object class is used to clone an object.
What is method overloading?,Method overloading is the polymorphism technique which allows us to create multiple methods with the same name but different signature. 
Why is method overloading not possible by changing the return type in java?,In Java method overloading is not possible by changing the return type of the program due to avoid the ambiguity.
Can we overload the methods by making them static?,No We cannot overload the methods by just applying the static keyword to them(number of parameters and types are the same).
Can we overload the main() method?,Yes we can have any number of main methods in a Java program by using method overloading. 
What is method overriding?,If a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its parent class it is known as Method Overriding. It is used for runtime polymorphism and to implement the interface methods.
Can we override the static method?,No you can't override the static method because they are the part of the class not the object.
Why can we not override static method?,It is because the static method is the part of the class and it is bound with class whereas instance method is bound with the object and static gets memory in class area and instance gets memory in a heap.
Can we override the overloaded method?,Yes.
Can we override the private methods?,No we cannot override the private methods because the scope of private methods is limited to the class and we cannot access them outside of the class.
Can you have virtual functions in Java?,Yes all functions in Java are virtual by default.
What is the final variable?,In Java the final variable is used to restrict the user from updating it. If we initialize the final variable we can't change its value. In other words we can say that the final variable once assigned to a value can never be changed after that. The final variable which is not assigned to any value can only be assigned through the class constructor.
What is the final blank variable?,A final variable not initialized at the time of declaration is known as the final blank variable. We can't initialize the final blank variable directly. Instead we have to initialize it by using the class constructor. It is useful in the case when the user has some data which must not be changed by others for example PAN Number.
Can we initialize the final blank variable?,Yes if it is not static we can initialize it in the constructor. If it is static blank final variable it can be initialized only in the static block.
Can we declare a constructor as final?,The constructor can never be declared as final because it is never inherited. Constructors are not ordinary methods; therefore there is no sense to declare constructors as final. However if you try to do so The compiler will throw an error.
