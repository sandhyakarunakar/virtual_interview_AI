What is C Language?,C programming language the pioneer of programming languages is a procedural programming language. Dennis Ritchie created it as a system programming language for writing operating systems. It is one of the most popular programming languages because of its structure high-level abstraction machine-independent feature etc. and is a great starting point for anyone wanting to get into coding. 
Why is C called a mid-level programming language?,C has characteristics of both assembly-level i.e. low-level and higher-level languages. So as a result C is commonly called a middle-level language. Using C a user can write an operating system as well as create a menu-driven consumer billing system.
What are the features of the C language?,It is Simple And Efficient. C language is portable or Machine Independent.C is a mid-level Programming Language. It is a structured Programming Language.C is super fast.Dynamic Memory Management.
What is a token?,The individual elements of a program are called Tokens.
What is the use of printf() and scanf() functions?,printf() is used to print the output on the display.scanf() is used to read formatted data from the keyboard. 
explain format specifiers?,%d: It's a datatype format specifier for printing and scanning an integer value. %s: It's a datatype format specifier for printing and scanning a string. %c: It's a datatype format specifier for displaying and scanning a character value.%f: The datatype format specifier %f is used to display and scan a float value.
What is a built-in function in C?,Built-function is also known as library functions that are provided by the system to make the life of a developer easy by assisting them to do certain commonly used predefined tasks.The most commonly used built-in functions in C are scanf() printf() strcpy strlwr strcmp strlen strcat and many more.
What is a Preprocessor?,A preprocessor is a software program that processes a source file before sending it to be compiled. Inclusion of header files macro expansions conditional compilation and line control are all possible with the preprocessor.
In C What is the #line used for?,In C #line is used as a preprocessor to re-set the line number in the code which takes a parameter as line number.
How can a string be converted to a number?,The function takes the string as an input that needs to be converted to an integer.
How can a number be converted to a string?,The function takes a pointer to an array of char elements that need to be converted and a format string needs to be written in a buffer as a string.
What is recursion in C?,When a function in C calls a copy of itself this is known as recursion. To put it another way when a function calls itself this technique is called Recursion. Also this function is known as recursive function.
Why doesn’t C support function overloading?,After you compile the C source the symbol names need to be intact in the object code. If we introduce function overloading in our source we should also provide name mangling as a preventive measure to avoid function name clashes. Also as C is not a strictly typed language many things(ex: data types) are convertible to each other in C. Therefore the complexity of overload resolution can introduce confusion in a language such as C.
What is the difference between global int and static int declaration?,The difference between this is in scope. A truly global variable has a global scope and is visible everywhere in your program.
What is a pointer in C?,A pointer is a variable that stores or points to another variable's address. The value of a variable is stored in a normal variable whereas the address of a variable is stored in a pointer variable.
Difference between const char* p and char const* p?,const char* p is a pointer to a const char.char const* p is a pointer to a char const.Since const char and char const are the same it's the same.
What is pointer to pointer in C?,In C a pointer can also be used to store the address of another pointer. A double pointer or pointer to pointer is such a pointer. The address of a variable is stored in the first pointer whereas the address of the first pointer is stored in the second pointer.
Why n++ executes faster than n+1 ?,n++ being a unary operation it just needs one variable. Whereas n = n + 1 is a binary operation that adds overhead to take more time (also binary operation: n += 1). However in modern platforms it depends on few things such as processor architecture C compiler usage in your code and other factors such as hardware problems.While in the modern compiler even if you write n = n + 1 it will get converted into n++ when it goes into the optimized binary and it will be equivalently efficient.
What is typecasting in C?,Typecasting is the process to convert a variable from one datatype to another.  If we want to store the large type value to an int type then we will convert the data type into another data type explicitly.
What are the advantages of Macro over function?,Macro on a high-level copy-paste its definitions to places wherever it is called. Due to which it saves a lot of time as no time is spent while passing the control to a new function and the control is always with the callee function. However one downside is the size of the compiled binary is large but once compiled the program comparatively runs faster.
What are Enumerations?,Enumeration also known as Enum in C is a user-defined data type. It consists of constant integrals or integers that have names assigned to them by the user. Because the integer values are named with enum in C the whole program is simple to learn understand and maintain by the same or even different programmer.
When should we use the register storage specifier?,If a variable is used frequently it should be declared with the register storage specifier and the compiler may allocate a CPU register for its storage to speed up variable lookup.
Specify different types of decision control statements?,All statements written in a program are executed from top to bottom one by one. Control statements are used to execute/transfer the control from one part of the program to another depending on the condition.
What is an r-value and l-value?,The term "r-value" refers to a data value stored in memory at a given address. An r-value is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it hence it can only exist on the right side of an assignment operator(=).The term "l-value" refers to a memory location that is used to identify an object. The l-value can be found on either the left or right side of an assignment operator(=). l-value is frequently used as an identifier.
What is the difference between malloc() and calloc()?,calloc() and malloc() are memory dynamic memory allocating functions. The main difference is that malloc() only takes one argument which is the number of bytes but calloc() takes two arguments which are the number of blocks and the size of each block.
What is the difference between struct and union in C?,A struct is a group of complex data structures stored in a block of memory where each member on the block gets a separate memory location to make them accessible at once Whereas in the union all the member variables are stored at the same location on the memory as a result to which while assigning a value to a member variable will change the value of all other members.
What is call by reference in functions?,When we caller function makes a function call bypassing the addresses of actual parameters being passed then this is called call by reference. In incall by reference the operation performed on formal parameters affects the value of actual parameters because all the operations performed on the value stored in the address of actual parameters.
What is pass by reference in functions?,In Pass by reference the callee receives the address and makes a copy of the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Callee function uses the address to access the actual argument (to do some manipulation). If the callee function changes the value addressed at the passed address it will be visible to the caller function as well.
What is a memory leak?,When we assign a variable it takes space of our RAM (either heap or RAM)dependent on the size of data type however if a programmer uses a memory available on the heap and forgets to a delta it at some point all the memory available on the ram will be occupied with no memory left this can lead to a memory leak.
How to avoid memory leak?,To avoid memory leaks you can trace all your memory allocations and think forward where you want to destroy (in a good sense) that memory and place delete there. Another way is to use C++ smart pointer in C linking it to GNU compilers.
What is Dynamic memory allocation in C? Name the dynamic allocation functions?,C is a language known for its low-level control over the memory allocation of variables in DMA there are two major standard library malloc() and free. The malloc() function takes a single input parameter which tells the size of the memory requested It returns a pointer to the allocated memory. If the allocation fails it returns NULL.
What is typedef?,typedef is a C keyword used to define alias/synonyms for an existing type in C language. In most cases we use typedef's to simplify the existing type declaration syntax. Or to provide specific descriptive names to a type.
Why is it usually a bad idea to use gets()? Suggest a workaround.,The standard input library gets() reads user input till it encounters a new line character. However it does not check on the size of the variable being provided by the user is under the maximum size of the data type which makes the system vulnerable to buffer overflow and the input being written into memory where it isn’t supposed to.
What are dangling pointers? How are dangling pointers different from memory leaks?,The dangling pointer points to a memory that has already been freed. The storage is no longer allocated. Trying to access it might cause a Segmentation fault. 
What is a near pointer and a far pointer in C?,Near Pointer: In general the near pointer can be considered because it is used to hold the address which has a maximum size of just 16 bits. We can't store an address with a size larger than 16 bits using the near pointer. Far Pointer: A far pointer is considered a pointer of size 32 bits. It can however use the current segment to access information stored outside the computer's memory. Although in order to use this type of pointer we usually need to allocate the sector register to store the data address in the current segment.
Which structure is used to link the program and the operating system?,The file structure is used to link the operating system and a program. The header file "stdio.h" (standard input/output header file) defines the file. It contains information about the file being used like its current size and its memory location. It contains a character pointer that points to the character which is currently being opened. When you open a file it establishes a link between the program and the operating system about which file is to be accessed.
Suppose a global variable and local variable have the same name. Is it possible to access a global variable from a block where local variables are defined?,No. This isn’t possible in C. It’s always the most local variable that gets preference.
Which is better #define or enum?,If we let it the compiler can build enum values automatically. However each of the defined values must be given separately.Some compilers will give a warning if we use enum values in a switch and the default case is missing.Unlike enum the macro does not have a defined scope constraint.
Can we compile a program without a main() function?,Yes we can compile a program without main() function Using Macro.
What is the use of a semicolon (;) at the end of every program statement?,It is majorly related to how the compiler reads( or parses) the entire code and breaks it into a set of instructions(or statements) to which semicolon in C acts as a boundary between two sets of instructions.
