They are what is called syntactic sugar that helps create filtered and modified lists and dictionaries from existing lists dictionaries or sets. They are handy and quick because you can write them in one line of code.
What are Python lambdas and why are they used?,Python lambdas are anonymous functions. They can accept multiple arguments but only have a single expression. They are used where a function is needed temporarily and will not be needed by other code. They are also limited in their scope of capabilities compared to a full function.

What are Python namespaces? Why are they used?,A namespace in Python ensures that object names in a program are unique and can be used without any conflict. Python implements these namespaces as dictionaries with 'name as key' mapped to a corresponding 'object as value'. This allows for multiple namespaces to use the same name and map it to a separate object.
What are decorators in Python?,Decorators in Python are essentially functions that add functionality to an existing function in Python without changing the structure of the function itself. 
What is the difference between xrange and range in Python?,xrange() and range() are quite similar in terms of functionality. They both generate a sequence of integers with the only difference that range() returns a Python list whereas xrange() returns an xrange object.
How Python is interpreted?,Python as a language is not interpreted or compiled. Python compiles the source code to a set of instructions for a virtual machine. The Python interpreter is an implementation of that virtual machine. This intermediate format is called “bytecode”.
What are iterators in Python?,An iterator is an object.It remembers its state i.e. where it is during iteration.Iterators are objects with which we can iterate over iterable objects like lists strings etc.

What are negative indexes and why are they used?,Negative indexes are the indexes from the end of the list or tuple or string.
How does inheritance work in python? ,Inheritance gives the power to a class to access all attributes and methods of another class. It aids in code reusability and helps the developer to maintain applications without redundant code.
Is Python a compiled language or an interpreted language?,Python is a partially compiled language and partially interpreted language. The compilation part is done first when we execute our code and this will generate byte code internally this byte code gets converted by the Python virtual machine(p.v.m) according to the underlying platform(machine+operating system).
What is the difference between a Mutable datatype and an Immutable data type?,Mutable data types can be edited i.e. they can change at runtime. Eg – List Dictionary etc.Immutable data types can not be edited i.e. they can not change at runtime. Eg – String Tuple etc.
How are arguments passed by value or by reference in Python?,Everything in Python is an object and all variables hold references to the objects. The reference values are according to the functions; as a result you cannot change the value of the references. However you can change the objects if it is mutable.
What is the difference between a Set and Dictionary?,The set is an unordered collection of data types that is iterable mutable and has no duplicate elements.A dictionary in Python is an ordered collection of data values used to store data values like a map.
What is List Comprehension in python?,List comprehension is a syntax construction to ease the creation of a list based on existing iterable.
What is swapcase function in Python?,It is a string’s function that converts all uppercase characters into lowercase and vice versa. It is used to alter the existing case of the string. This method creates a copy of the string which contains all the characters in the swap case.
Can we Pass a function as an argument in Python?,Yes Several arguments can be passed to a function including objects variables (of the same or distinct data types) and functions.
What are *args and *kwargs?,To pass a variable number of arguments to a function in Python use the special syntax *args and **kwargs in the function specification. It is used to pass a variable-length keyword-free argument list. By using the * the variable we associate with the * becomes iterable allowing you to do operations on it such as iterating over it and using higher-order operations like map and filter.
Is Indentation Required in Python?,Yes indentation is required in Python.
