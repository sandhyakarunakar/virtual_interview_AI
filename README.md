# Smart Preparation for interview to enhance the skills with AI

# Abstract
-----------
The AI-Powered Interview Practice System is a groundbreaking project designed to transform the way individuals prepare for job interviews. The process begins with users uploading their resumes, which are meticulously analyzed by a sophisticated Resume Parser. This parsing technology extracts crucial information such as skills, interests, and project details. Leveraging this data, the system employs scraping of interview questions specifically tailored to the user's profile from csv files. During the interview, the AI system poses questions extracted and evaluates user responses in real time. A unique Advanced natural language processing model compares the user's answers to expected responses, providing accuracy scores for each question. The AI-Powered Interview Practice System empowers users to refine their interview skills, receive constructive feedback, and gain confidence in a simulated interview setting. This innovative project bridges the gap between resume preparation and real-life interviews.
